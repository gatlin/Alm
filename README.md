Alm
===

A small reactive application library written in TypeScript. Heavily inspired by
React, Redux, and Elm.

(c) 2016, 2017 Gatlin Johnson <gatlin@niltag.net>

Synopsis
---

See [the website][almsite] for examples.

Installation
---

You'll need `webpack` and `tsc`.

    $> npm install
    $> npm run compile
    $> npm run bundle

The TypeScript files will be converted to JavaScript under the `lib/` directory
and a bundle ready to be included directly in the browser will be present in
`_bundles/`. Minified versions are available alongside them.

Documentation
---

Right now the best documentation is the code itself. There are JSDoc-esque
comments and plenty of type annotations. Additionally [the website][almsite] has
examples and explanations.
