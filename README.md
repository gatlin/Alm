0. Synopsis

See `example/` for a simple TODO application. It is currently [live
here](http://niltag.net/almtest).

1. What?

Functional reactive programming (**FRP**) is really cool. [Elm][elm] is also
really cool, because it is an effective, elegant, and practical execution of
those ideas.

However, it's not JavaScript. I want to take advantage of FRP -- and in
particular, Elm's interpretation of it -- in native JavaScript. So I
re-implemented the same core ideas as this library.

The name is a reference not only to [Elm][elm] but to the idea of *alms*,
charity given to the poor and needy. I think Elm has really contributed some
innovative ideas and practical code to a space which sorely needed it.
